# Understanding Speculative Decoding: Mechanisms, Mathematical Modeling, and Speed Formula

## Introduction to Speculative Decoding

Speculative decoding is an advanced method in natural language processing that enhances the speed of large language models (LLMs). It operates on a "Draft-then-Verify" paradigm that consists of the following steps:

1. **Drafting**: A smaller, faster model generates multiple speculative tokens ahead in the sequence.
2. **Verification**: The main, more accurate LLM verifies these speculative tokens in parallel.
3. **Acceptance and Rejection**: Accepted tokens are appended to the final output, while rejected tokens lead to restarting the drafting process from the rejection point.

This mechanism effectively transforms sequential token generation into a more parallelized operation, leveraging the parallel verification process to achieve significant speed improvements.

## Mathematical Modeling of Speculative Decoding

To model speculative decoding mathematically, we need to determine the expected number of tokens accepted from a batch of speculative tokens. This is akin to a problem in probability involving coin tosses, where you want to find the expected number of consecutive "heads" (accepted tokens) before encountering a "tail" (rejection).

### Recursive Approach for Expected Tokens

**Define the Problem:**
- Let E_k be the expected number of consecutive accepted tokens starting when you have already accepted k tokens.

**Base Case:**
- If all N tokens are accepted, E_N = N.

**Recursive Relation:**
- For 0 ≤ k < N:
  - You either accept another token with probability P, or you reject (end the streak) with probability 1-P.
  - This gives the recursive formula:

**Solving the Recurrence:**
- Begin with E_N = N and work backwards to find E_0:
  - This relates to summing a geometric series: E_0 = P + P² + ... + P^N
  - The closed form is:

This formula provides the expected number of accepted tokens (K) when speculating with finite sequences of tokens.

## Deriving the Speed Formula

### Components of the Speed Formula

1. **Speculative Time**: The time to speculate tokens, T_s · N
2. **Verification Time**: The time to verify the batch of tokens, T_v

3. **Total Process Time**: For K+1 tokens (where one more token is added post-verification):

4. **Average Time per Token**:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{Average%20time%20per%20token}%20=%20\frac{T_s%20\cdot%20N%20+%20T_v}{P%20\frac{1-P^N}{1-P}%20+%201}" />

5. **Final Simplified Formula**:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{Average%20time%20per%20token}%20=%20\frac{(T_s%20\cdot%20N%20+%20T_v)%20\cdot%20(1-P)}{1%20-%20P^{N+1}}" />

## Conclusion

The speculative decoding approach significantly speeds up token generation in LLMs by allowing parallel processing of speculative drafts. The mathematical modeling, rooted in probability theory, provides a robust framework to predict performance improvements and optimize the speculative decoding process.

**Optimization Insight**:
- High acceptance probability (P) and efficient use of speculation and verification resources lead to better performance.
- Selecting an optimal number of tokens to speculate (N) balances the benefits of parallelism and the cost of potential rejections.

This method showcases how innovative algorithms and precise mathematical models can enhance computational efficiency in modern AI systems.
